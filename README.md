An open-source application that helps track tdd progress. Once the kata or exercise is done, one can review key points in time in code creation, both for tests and production-code.

Many aspects can be seen in the review; here are a few: 
- see if production code was written without tests (major violation)
- see if refactoring was performed without running tests first
- see if tests were run before production code was written
- see if too much or too little production code was implemented for a specific test 
- see if the right tests were written at the right time
- see if too much time was taken to create the implementation corresponding to a test

The most important thing is that:
- lessons can be learnt for the process of tdd
- lessons can be learnt as to how to write tests better
- lessons can be learnt as to how much code to write for specific tests
- lessons can be learnt about avoiding the traps of writing code without tests
